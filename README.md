# Heart-Disease-Predictor
This project uses machine learning to predict heart disease from clinical data. Models like Random Forest, SVM, and ANN were tested, with Random Forest achieving top accuracy. Feature engineering and clustering helped identify high-risk patients, aiming to improve early diagnosis and healthcare outcomes.
